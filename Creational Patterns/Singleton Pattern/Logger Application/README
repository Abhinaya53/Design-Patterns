# Problem
You are tasked with creating a Logger class that provides a single point of access for logging messages throughout your application. This class should ensure that only one instance of the logger exists to avoid conflicts and ensure consistency in logging behavior.

Requirements:
- Provide methods to log messages at different levels (e.g., info, warn, error).
- Each log message should include a timestamp and the log level.
- Ensure that the logger is thread-safe.
