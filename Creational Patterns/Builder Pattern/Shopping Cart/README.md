# Problem:
Design a Shopping Cart System.
- The cart should be flexible to support multiple optional fields. A user may:
- Add multiple items (products with quantity and price).
- Optionally apply coupon codes.
- Optionally enable gift wrap.
- Optionally add special delivery instructions.

The system should allow step-by-step construction of a cart object without requiring all fields upfront.
