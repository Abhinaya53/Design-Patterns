# Problem:
Design a Document Creation Application.
- The application should allow users to create different types of documents, such as PDF, Word, and HTML.
- Each document type will have a method to open, save, and close the document.
- The system should be designed in a way that makes it easy to add new document types in the future without modifying existing code.
- Clients should work with a common interface and not worry about the exact type of document being created.
