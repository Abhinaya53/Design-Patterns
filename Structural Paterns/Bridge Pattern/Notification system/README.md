# Problem Statement:
You are asked to design a Notification System for Amazon.

The requirements are:
- The system should support different types of notifications:
    - Email
    - SMS
    - Push Notification

- The system should be able to send messages through different service providers:
    - Twilio
    - Amazon SNS
    - Firebase

- The design should be flexible enough to allow adding new notification types and/or new service providers independently.
