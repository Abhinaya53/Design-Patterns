# Problem:
Develop a Document Editor that allows users to create and edit text documents. Each character in the document has specific formatting attributes (like font style, size, and color), which can lead to a large memory footprint if each character object is created independently. Develop a design to optimize memory usage and enhance performance.

# Hint:
Extrinsic State: The character itself (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C').
Intrinsic State: Formatting attributes (e.g., font style, size, color).
