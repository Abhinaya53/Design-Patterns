# Functional Requirements:
- User (passanger) should be able to request ride.
- App should assign the nearest available driver when passenger requests for a ride.
- The App supports different types of vehicles such as cars, bikes, luxury cars and so on.
- The system uses 3 different fare calculation techniques such as standard, shared, luxury. 
- Ride status notification should be sent to both passenger and driver.

# Non - Functional Requirements:
- The app should be scalable. For instance, developers should be able to add new vehicle types or fare calculation strategies without changing any core functionalities.
- The app should adhere to SOLID principles and make use of various design patterns such that the app should be easy to maintain and extend.
- The app should be extensible. We should be able to add new new vehicle types or fare calculation strategies without modifying core ride matching logic.
