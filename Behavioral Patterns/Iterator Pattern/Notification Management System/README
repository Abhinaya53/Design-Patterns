# Problem Statement:
Design a notification management system that allows users to iterate over their notifications in a sequential manner. The system will manage different types of notifications, such as:
- Email notifications
- SMS notifications
- Push notifications
Each type of notification should be stored in its own collection. The system must provide a way to access and iterate over these notifications one by one, without exposing the underlying structure or implementation of the collections.
